# APSA 1.6.0 release candidate

This release packages the source-stage improvements previously developed after
1.5.1: bounded native cross-file analysis, JS/TS/Dart candidates, explicit
APKS selection, signature consistency and supplied-anchor evidence, dependency
selection and OSV exclusions, runtime observation contracts, large-input
staging/reporting and the subsequent CLI/parser/job/store review fixes.
Rule version: `2026.10.15.apsa.160`.

## Upgrade effects

- New candidate findings, partial reasons and stricter source input binding can
  change policy outcomes. Skipped symlinks and ambiguous report-store roots do
  not produce complete scans. Narrow the input or resolve ambiguity explicitly.
- MCP adds tools/schema fields. Pin consumers to the served manifest hashes in
  `tests/contracts/mcp_tool_manifest_pending.json`; the historical published
  manifest is retained and this file is not an approved policy baseline.
- Existing reports, baselines and waivers remain user-owned. No baseline or
  policy is automatically approved, relaxed or re-keyed during release.
- Persistent report exports use no-replace hard links for ownership-safe
  rollback. The store must reside on a filesystem supporting same-directory
  hard links; an unsupported filesystem fails rather than claiming a save.
  Cancellation remains cooperative when process identity cannot be inspected.

## Verification and limits

The prior exact source snapshot `50f1a0f` passed eleven supported CI jobs and
four package/MCP jobs. Those observations are historical; the 1.6 candidate
requires its own supported CI, repeated package-content checks, clean install
and two independent reviews before publication.

Synthetic benchmark execution preserves incomplete controls: the fresh corpus
reports `passed=false` while its declared regression contract passes. Public
CVE alias overlap cases remain unscored; the component benchmark's failure is
preserved. Comparator partial results establish no accuracy or product ranking.
Physical devices and genuine Apple signing identity/provisioning/revocation
remain unverified. iOS OS URL delivery remains an explicit open validation
item until a new installed target supplies nonce/session/build-bound callbacks.
Transport dispatch, process startup and HTTP backend-only success cannot
substitute for target acquisition.

Publication uses the stable version/tag match, required CI, repeated verified
wheel/sdist build and Trusted Publishing. A separate post-publication workflow
checks PyPI and release digests, tag/source binding, MCP Registry metadata and
cold installation/startup using new synthetic fixtures. A published version is
reported complete only after its public artifacts and those checks succeed.
